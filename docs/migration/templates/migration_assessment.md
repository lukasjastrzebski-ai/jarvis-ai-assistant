## Migration Scope Recommendation

### Assessment Factors

| Factor | Value | Points Toward |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Feature count | | Minimal / Standard / Full |
| Team size | | Minimal / Standard / Full |
| Regulatory requirements | | Minimal / Standard / Full |
| Test coverage | | Minimal / Standard / Full |
| Documentation exists | | Minimal / Standard / Full |
| Available time | | Minimal / Standard / Full |

### Recommended Scope

**[ ] Minimal** - Best for small projects, quick adoption
- Time estimate: 3-5 hours
- Documents MVP features only
- Basic system architecture

**[ ] Standard** - Best for most production projects
- Time estimate: 5-8 hours
- Full MVP specifications
- Major ADRs documented

**[ ] Full** - Best for complex/regulated projects
- Time estimate: 8-13 hours
- All features documented
- Comprehensive ADR coverage
