# Signal Normalization

Normalization allows signals from different domains to be compared meaningfully.

---

## Purpose
- reduce noise
- highlight trends
- support decision ranking

---

## Example normalization
- raw values → percentage change
- absolute counts → rates
- short-term vs long-term trend comparison

---

## Scoring (optional)
Signals MAY be assigned scores if useful:
- impact score
- urgency score
- confidence score

Scoring is advisory, not authoritative.
