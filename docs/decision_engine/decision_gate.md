# Decision Gate

This document defines how decision outputs are approved.

---

## Rule

Decision engine outputs do NOT trigger execution automatically.

Execution requires explicit Product Owner approval.

---

## Approval process

- Review decision output
- Verify inputs and assumptions
- Accept, modify, or reject recommendations

---

## Documentation

Record approvals or rejections:
- inline in the decision output
- or via linked PO override document

No approval, no execution.
