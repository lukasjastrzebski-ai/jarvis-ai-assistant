# Lessons Learned Process

This document defines how the factory improves over time.

---

## When to capture lessons

- repeated execution friction
- quality incidents
- missed requirements
- tooling failures

---

## Lesson content

Each lesson must include:
- trigger event
- root cause
- factory failure point
- proposed factory change
- validation plan

---

## Applying lessons

- lessons are reviewed post-release
- approved lessons result in factory changes
- version bump required for material changes

---

## Discipline

Do not change the factory impulsively.
Change it because evidence demands it.
