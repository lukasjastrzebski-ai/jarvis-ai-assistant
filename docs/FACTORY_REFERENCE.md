# Factory Reference

Deep reference documentation for the Product Factory.

## Authority Hierarchy

When sources conflict, apply this order (source: [docs/ai.md](ai.md)):

| Priority | Source | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | docs/ai.md | Binding contract |
| 2 | specs/, architecture/, plan/ | Frozen specifications |
| 3 | docs/execution/* | Execution guidance |
| 4 | Memory and chat | Context only |

**Decision rule:** If sources conflict, the lower-numbered source always wins.

Files always override chat and memory.

## Marker Files

### Location: .factory/

| Marker | Created by | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `KICKOFF_COMPLETE` | Kickoff process | Factory initialized for product |
| `PLANNING_FROZEN` | Stage 7 completion | specs/, architecture/, plan/ are read-only |
| `STAGE_7_COMPLETE` | Stage 7 completion | AI contract finalized |
| `RUN_MODE` | Mode transition | Contains "PLANNING" or "EXECUTION" |
| `LAST_KNOWN_GOOD_SHA` | Various | Git SHA of last validated state |
| `factory_version.txt` | Kickoff | Copied from FACTORY_VERSION |
| `EXTENSION_ACTIVE` | Extension flow | Extension/customization mode enabled |

### CI enforcement

The `factory-guardrails.yml` workflow validates markers exist as appropriate (source: [.github/workflows/factory-guardrails.yml](../.github/workflows/factory-guardrails.yml)):
- `KICKOFF_COMPLETE` must always exist
- `STAGE_7_COMPLETE` and `PLANNING_FROZEN` must exist in execution mode

## Skills Overview

Skills are structured operating procedures for Claude Code. They do not replace the task runner or execution rules (source: [docs/skills/README.md](skills/README.md)).

| Skill | Purpose | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 01 - Context Loader | Load authoritative context before execution | [skill_01](skills/skill_01_context_loader.md) |
| 02 - Task Intake | Safely ingest a task before execution | [skill_02](skills/skill_02_task_intake.md) |
| 03 - Test Alignment | Ensure test discipline before coding | [skill_03](skills/skill_03_test_alignment.md) |
| 04 - Implementation | Execute scoped implementation after GO | [skill_04](skills/skill_04_implementation.md) |
| 05 - Run Checks | Execute commands and validate outcomes | [skill_05](skills/skill_05_run_checks.md) |
| 06 - Write Report | Persist execution outcome to disk | [skill_06](skills/skill_06_write_report.md) |
| 07 - Update State | Keep execution state accurate | [skill_07](skills/skill_07_update_state.md) |
| 08 - Next Task Recommendation | Suggest next action without authorizing | [skill_08](skills/skill_08_next_task_recommendation.md) |
| 09 - CR/NF Router | Route scope changes to correct flow | [skill_09](skills/skill_09_cr_new_feature_router.md) |
| 10 - Signal Snapshot and Decision | Generate decision inputs from signals | [skill_10](skills/skill_10_signal_snapshot_and_decision.md) |
| 11 - External Doc Import | Parse external tool exports | [skill_11](skills/skill_11_external_doc_import.md) |
| 12 - Gap Analysis | Validate completeness against factory requirements | [skill_12](skills/skill_12_gap_analysis.md) |
| 13 - Gap Resolution | Iterate with PO to fill planning gaps | [skill_13](skills/skill_13_gap_resolution.md) |
| 14 - Codebase Research | Research codebase before complex tasks | [skill_14](skills/skill_14_codebase_research.md) |

### Skill rules

- Skills never expand scope
- Skills never bypass GO/NEXT
- Skills never override files
- If a skill conflicts with docs/ai.md or task_runner.md, the skill is wrong

### Invocation model

Skills are invoked internally by Claude to maintain discipline. They are not commands the operator issues. The operator issues:
- Task requests (e.g., "Run TASK-XXX via the task runner")
- Gate responses (GO, NEXT, STOP, BLOCKED)

## Context Engineering Patterns

Patterns for managing Claude Code context window effectively:

| Pattern | Purpose | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Context Compaction | Compress context mid-task, resume from file | [context_compaction](patterns/context_compaction.md) |
| Trajectory Management | Avoid correction spirals that poison context | [trajectory_management](patterns/trajectory_management.md) |
| Initializer Agent | Bootstrap session with consistent startup | [initializer_agent](patterns/initializer_agent.md) |
| Sandboxed Execution | Run risky operations in isolated environment | [sandboxed_execution](patterns/sandboxed_execution.md) |

### Key Concepts

- **The "Dumb Zone"**: LLM performance degrades around 40% context capacity
- **Trajectory Poisoning**: Repeated corrections teach the model to fail
- **Sub-agents**: Delegate research to disposable contexts, return summaries only
- **Mid-task Compaction**: Save progress to `.factory/session_context.md`, /clear, resume

See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#context-engineering) for operational guidance.

## CI Workflows

### factory-guardrails.yml (source: [.github/workflows/factory-guardrails.yml](../.github/workflows/factory-guardrails.yml))

**Trigger:** Pull requests and pushes to main

**Steps:**
1. Validate kickoff complete (`.factory/KICKOFF_COMPLETE`)
2. Validate planning freeze markers in execution mode
3. Validate COMPLETE tasks have reports
4. Validate Test Delta for in-progress tasks
5. Validate gate approvals for CR/NF execution
6. Validate MVP features have test plans
7. Validate report content (Summary, Tests, Acceptance criteria sections)
8. Verify report signatures (optional, non-blocking)

### quality-autopilot.yml (source: [.github/workflows/quality-autopilot.yml](../.github/workflows/quality-autopilot.yml))

**Trigger:** Pull requests and pushes to main

**Steps:**
1. Install dependencies (pnpm if pnpm-lock.yaml exists)
2. Run unit tests (`pnpm test` if package.json exists)

## Signals System

### Signal contract (source: [docs/signals/signal_contract.md](signals/signal_contract.md))

Required fields for every signal:
- name
- source
- timestamp
- value
- trend (up / down / flat)
- confidence (high / medium / low)

### Signal sources (source: [docs/signals/signal_sources.md](signals/signal_sources.md))

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Analytics | activation rate, retention, conversion, funnel drop-offs |
| Errors | CI failure rate, production error rate, crash rate |
| Performance | p95/p99 latency, timeout rate, job failures |
| Revenue | MRR, churn, ARPU, failed payments |
| Manual PO | strategic pivots, customer feedback, compliance concerns |

### Signal snapshot (source: [docs/signals/signal_snapshot.md](signals/signal_snapshot.md))

Point-in-time summary used as input to decision engine. Includes:
- Metadata (date, product, generated_by, data sources)
- Signal entries with value, trend, confidence
- Interpretation summary

Snapshots do not mandate actions.

### PO Override (source: [docs/signals/po_override.md](signals/po_override.md))

Manual PO signals override automated recommendations. Used for:
- Strategic pivots
- Customer commitments
- Legal/compliance issues
- Existential business risks

## Decision Engine

### Gate (source: [docs/decision_engine/decision_gate.md](decision_engine/decision_gate.md))

Decision engine outputs do NOT trigger execution automatically. Execution requires explicit Product Owner approval.

### Inputs (source: [docs/decision_engine/decision_inputs.md](decision_engine/decision_inputs.md))

**Allowed inputs:**
- Signal snapshots
- Execution state
- Open tasks and phases
- Known regressions
- Manual PO overrides

**Forbidden inputs:**
- Chat-only context
- Unverified memory
- Speculation
- Partial or stale signals

### Rules (source: [docs/decision_engine/decision_rules.md](decision_engine/decision_rules.md))

Priority order:
1. Critical regressions
2. Blocked execution issues
3. Planned tasks in current phase
4. High-confidence signal-driven improvements
5. New features (after impact analysis)

## Quality Gates

### Pass criteria (source: [docs/quality/quality_gate.md](quality/quality_gate.md))

Execution may continue if:
- All required tests pass
- No known regressions exist
- Acceptance criteria met
- Quality baseline respected

### Fail criteria (source: [docs/quality/quality_gate.md](quality/quality_gate.md))

Execution must STOP if:
- Critical tests fail
- Regressions detected
- Reports incomplete
- Quality baseline violated

### Quality baseline (source: [docs/quality/quality_baseline.md](quality/quality_baseline.md))

Minimum standards:
- Code compiles and runs
- No unused variables or dead code
- Linting passes
- New logic has test coverage
- Critical paths have integration/E2E coverage
- Bug fixes include regression tests
- No known performance or security regressions

### Regression rules (source: [docs/quality/quality_regression_rules.md](quality/quality_regression_rules.md))

Response to regression:
1. STOP execution
2. Identify scope
3. Fix immediately, rollback, or open Change Request

Skipping regressions is forbidden.
