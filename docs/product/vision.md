# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

**Jarvis is a personal operating system for decisions and execution.**

You stop being the router for everything. Jarvis becomes the router.

---

## Core Beliefs

### 1. Action Over Chat
Every interaction should end in an action, a queued action, or a decision captured. Jarvis is not a chatbot - it's an operator.

### 2. Voice-First, Not Voice-Only
Voice is the primary input for capture and control. Visual interface exists for review, planning, editing, and audit. Neither is optional.

### 3. One Interface, Two Contexts
- **iPhone:** Capture, quick approvals, life ops
- **Mac:** Deep work, batch triage, planning

### 4. Trust Through Execution
Jarvis earns trust by executing reliably within boundaries, not by being impressive in demos. Trust is built incrementally: Assist → Operate → Autopilot.

## What Success Looks Like

### For the User
- Morning: "Jarvis, what matters today?" → Clear plan with 3-5 outcomes
- Email: "Reply yes, push to next week, keep it friendly" → Draft appears, approve with voice
- End of day: 5 open loops surfaced, 2 nudged, 3 scheduled for tomorrow
- Weekly: Accomplishments compiled, next week planned, decisions captured

### For the Business
- Users stop checking other productivity apps
- Time-to-value under 5 minutes (first successful action)
- 80%+ of interactions result in executed actions
- Users graduate from Assist to Operator mode within 2 weeks

## North Star

**Jarvis is the first AI that makes you feel like you have a competent chief of staff - not a smart speaker, not a chatbot, but an operator who knows your priorities and protects your time.**

---

## Anti-Vision (What We're NOT Building)

- Not a general chatbot for questions
- Not a replacement for project management tools
- Not a scheduling link (Calendly competitor)
- Not a note-taking app
- Not a "productivity dashboard" with charts
- Not an automation builder (Zapier competitor)

We build one thing: an operator that runs your day.
