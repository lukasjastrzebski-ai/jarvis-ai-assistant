### Day in the Life
```
7:00 AM   Wake up, check phone for urgent messages
7:30 AM   Email triage while making coffee (30 min lost)
8:30 AM   Start "deep work" but interrupted by Slack
9:15 AM   Customer call (unprepared, scrambles for context)
10:00 AM  Try to code, but email backlog grows
12:00 PM  Lunch, more email, task list anxiety

5:00 PM   Realize 3 important emails went unanswered
7:00 PM   Evening work to catch up (burned out)
```

- Respond to key stakeholders within 24 hours
- Stop working evenings/weekends
- Feel in control, not overwhelmed

### Tech Stack
- MacBook Pro + iPhone

- Slack (3-5 workspaces)
- Notion or Linear for tasks
- Stripe for payments

### Buying Behavior
- Willing to pay for tools that actually work
- Tries 10 productivity apps, keeps 2
- Values simplicity over features
- Skeptical of AI hype

### Quote
