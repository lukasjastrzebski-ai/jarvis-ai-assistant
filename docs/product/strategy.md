## Strategic Positioning

### Market Position
Voice-first AI chief of staff for solo entrepreneurs on Apple platforms.

### Competitive Differentiation
| Competitor | Gap We Exploit |
|------------|----------------|
| Siri/Alexa | No memory, no context, can't operate |
| ChatGPT/Claude | Chat-only, no integrations, no execution |
| Notion AI | Document-focused, not operator |
| Motion/Reclaim | Calendar-only, no communications |
| Superhuman | Email-only, no voice, no cross-tool |

**Our moat:** Deep integration + voice-first + memory = operator behavior, not chat behavior.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Wedge (MVP)
**Focus:** Unified Inbox + Drafting + Daily Planning

Entry point is email/calendar triage because:
- Highest pain, daily frequency
- Clear value demonstration (time saved)
- Low trust requirement (review before send)
- Builds data for personalization

### Phase 2: Expand
**Add:** Scheduling, meeting briefs, follow-up automation

Once users trust drafts:
- Introduce scheduling autonomy
- Add meeting preparation
- Automate follow-up tracking

### Phase 3: Platform
**Add:** Workflows, CRM updates, content publishing

When users are in Operator mode:
- Custom workflow templates
- Third-party integrations
- Autopilot capabilities

## Tradeoffs

### We Choose...

| Over This | We Choose This |
|-----------|---------------|
| Feature breadth | Depth in core jobs |
| Android support | Apple ecosystem excellence |
| Enterprise | Solo entrepreneur |
| Freemium | Premium positioning |
| Viral growth | Direct value proposition |
| AI chat flexibility | Constrained, reliable execution |

### Explicit Non-Investments

- No Android app (focus on Apple)
- No team/collaboration features (solo users)
- No third-party plugin marketplace (control quality)
- No free tier (attracts wrong users)

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Target Price: $79/month (billed annually)

Justification:
- 10 hours saved/month = $8/hour value (low estimate)
- Premium positioning attracts serious users
- Supports quality AI inference costs
- No free tier = no support burden from non-payers

### Alternative Considered
- $29/month: Too cheap, attracts tire-kickers
- $149/month: Too expensive, limits market
- Freemium: Wrong users, high support cost

---

## Success Metrics (Strategic)

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Paying users | 1,000 | Month 6 |
| MRR | $50K | Month 9 |
| Churn | <5%/month | Month 6+ |
| NPS | >50 | Month 6+ |

## Key Bets

### Bet 1: Voice-First Works
Users will prefer voice for quick interactions over typing.
**Risk mitigation:** Visual app always available as fallback.

### Bet 2: Trust Can Be Earned
Users will graduate from Assist to Operator mode.
**Risk mitigation:** Granular permissions, audit log, undo.

### Bet 3: Unified Inbox Wins
Consolidating inputs is more valuable than any single integration.
**Risk mitigation:** Start with high-frequency channels (email, calendar).

### Bet 4: Solo Entrepreneur is Underserved
Enterprise tools are overkill, consumer tools are underpowered.
**Risk mitigation:** Direct user research, iterate fast.
