# Skill 04 – Implementation

Purpose:
Execute scoped implementation after GO is granted.

Steps:
1) Confirm GO was explicitly given.
2) Re-read task scope and expected files.
3) Implement only in-scope changes.
4) Avoid refactors or improvements not required by the task.
5) If new requirements emerge, STOP and route to CR/New Feature.

Output:
- implemented code changes limited to scope
- list of files changed
