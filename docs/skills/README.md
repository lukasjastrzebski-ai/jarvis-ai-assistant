# Claude Skills

Claude Skills are structured operating procedures used during execution.
They do NOT replace the Task Runner or execution rules.
They are invoked internally by Claude to stay disciplined.

## v20 Role-Specific Skills

These skills are used in v20 autonomous mode by specific roles.

### Product Owner Skills

- Skills never expand scope
- Skills never bypass GO/NEXT
- Skills never override files

If a skill conflicts with docs/ai.md or task_runner.md, the skill is wrong.
