# Pilot Mode

**Version:** 20.0

This document describes the supervised pilot mode for initial v20 testing.

---

## Overview

Pilot mode enables running v20 with enhanced DD oversight for testing and validation before full autonomous operation.

---

## Pilot Mode Features

Think of pilot mode as "v20 with training wheels" - you get autonomous execution with enhanced visibility and easy intervention.

### What Pilot Mode Does

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Verbose Logging** | Every PO decision printed to console with reasoning |
| **Decision Visibility** | See what PO is thinking before it acts |
| **Easy Abort** | Stop execution at any time with ABORT |
| **Status Updates** | More frequent status output |

### What Pilot Mode Does NOT Change

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| GO/NEXT gates | Still automated (unless you enable confirmations) |
| Parallel execution | Still runs multiple agents |
| Escalations | Still auto-pause on BLOCKING |
| State management | Same as full autonomous |

### When to Use Pilot Mode

**Use pilot mode when:**
- First time using v20
- Testing new project with v20
- Want to observe PO decision-making
- Learning how the system works

**Switch to full autonomous when:**
- Comfortable with PO decisions
- Execution is stable
- Want maximum speed

### Easy Rollback

- Quick switch to v10.x mode
- State preservation
- No data loss

## Enabling Pilot Mode

### Activation

```bash
# Create pilot mode marker
echo "pilot" > .factory/V20_PILOT

# Or via config
{
  "execution_mode": "pilot",
  "require_go_confirmation": false,
  "require_next_confirmation": false,
  "verbose_logging": true
}
```

### Deactivation

```bash
# Switch to full autonomous
rm .factory/V20_PILOT

# Or update config
{
  "execution_mode": "autonomous"
}
```

## Pilot Mode Behavior

### Default Pilot Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| verbose_logging | true | Detailed logs |
| require_go_confirmation | false | DD confirms GO |
| require_next_confirmation | false | DD confirms NEXT |
| show_all_decisions | true | Display reasoning |
| batch_review | false | Review each batch |

### Checkpoint Options

**GO Checkpoint:**
```
[PILOT] About to issue GO for TASK-001

Plan validated:
  - AC coverage: complete
  - File scope: verified
  - Test delta: addressed

Proceed with GO? [Y/n/details]:
```

**NEXT Checkpoint:**
```
[PILOT] About to issue NEXT for TASK-001

Report validated:
  - AC verified: 5/5
  - Tests passed: 12/12
  - Files: 3 changed

Proceed with NEXT? [Y/n/details]:
```

## Verbose Logging

### Log Levels

| Level | Content |
|-------|---------|
| INFO | Major events |
| DEBUG | Decisions and reasoning |
| TRACE | All operations |

### Log Output

## Transitioning from Pilot

### Criteria for Full Autonomous

Before disabling pilot mode:

- [ ] 10+ tasks completed successfully
- [ ] Escalation flow tested
- [ ] Recovery tested
- [ ] No unexpected behaviors
- [ ] DD comfortable with system

### Transition Steps

1. Review pilot mode results
2. Address any issues found
3. Disable pilot markers
4. Enable full autonomous mode
5. Monitor first autonomous phase

---

## Fallback to v10.x

If issues during pilot:

```bash
# Quick fallback
rm .factory/V20_MODE
rm .factory/V20_PILOT

# PO will detect and switch to v10.x compatibility
```

## Session Summary

- Tasks attempted: 5
- Tasks completed: 4
- Tasks blocked: 1
- Interventions: 2

## DD Interventions

1. GO checkpoint for TASK-003
   - Reason: Wanted to review plan
   - Outcome: Approved

2. NEXT checkpoint for TASK-004
   - Reason: Verify test coverage
   - Outcome: Approved

## Issues Detected

- None critical

## Recommendations

- System behaving as expected
- Consider disabling GO checkpoints
