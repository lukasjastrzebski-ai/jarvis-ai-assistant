Jarvis for a solo entrepreneur on iPhone + Mac

A voice-first, cross-device AI chief of staff that runs your day, protects your focus, and executes work across your tools. It talks like Siri, but it is not a “smart speaker assistant”. It is an operator with memory, workflows, and accountability.

The test of success is simple: you stop being the router for everything. Jarvis becomes the router.

Vision

Jarvis is a personal operating system for decisions and execution.
	•	Voice is the default input.
	•	A clean visual app exists for review, correction, and high-density work.
	•	It connects to your real tools (mail, calendar, docs, tasks, CRM, banking, Slack, etc.) and can take actions with permission.
	•	It learns your operating style, then enforces it: priorities, boundaries, routines, and quality bars.

What you are buying is not “answers”. You are buying:
	•	fewer context switches
	•	fewer dropped balls
	•	faster throughput on repetitive work
	•	better decision hygiene

Non-negotiable product principles
	1.	Action over chat. Every interaction should end in an action, a queued action, or a decision captured.
	2.	Voice-first, not voice-only. Voice for capture and control. Visual for review, planning, editing, and audit.
	3.	One interface, two contexts. iPhone for capture, quick approvals, life ops. Mac for deep work, batch triage, planning.
	4.	Explicit permissions. Jarvis can draft and propose freely. Sending money, sending emails, deleting, publishing requires explicit confirmation rules.
	5.	Trust through audit. Every action is logged, reversible where possible, and explainable.
	6.	Minimal UI, maximum power. If the UI looks “feature-rich”, you already lost.

Core jobs to be done

For a single entrepreneur, Jarvis must win in these lanes:

1) Command center for priorities
	•	Maintains a live “today plan” with 3-5 outcomes and time blocks.
	•	Detects overload and forces tradeoffs.
	•	Keeps a single canonical backlog across tasks, emails, notes, messages.

2) Communications operator
	•	Email and message triage.
	•	Drafts, rewrites, summarizes, schedules followups.
	•	Creates “waiting on” lists automatically.
	•	Nudges you when you are avoiding high-leverage conversations.

3) Calendar and meeting co-pilot
	•	Schedules across constraints and preferences.
	•	Pre-briefs you before meetings with context, goals, last threads, and suggested asks.
	•	Captures meeting outcomes into tasks, followups, CRM updates.

4) Work execution assistant
	•	Creates docs, proposals, invoices, specs.
	•	Turns voice rambles into structured outputs.
	•	Runs repeatable workflows: “publish release notes”, “prepare customer update”, “compile weekly metrics”.

5) Personal life logistics
	•	Reminders with real context (not dumb alarms).
	•	Travel, errands, household tasks, recurring routines.
	•	Health and finance nudges if you opt in, but no judgment, just execution.

Feature set as a platform

A) Multimodal interface

Voice interaction
	•	“Jarvis, plan my day around these 3 priorities…”
	•	“Jarvis, reply to Anna politely, propose Tue 10 or Wed 2, keep it short.”
	•	“Jarvis, remind me when I arrive home to order filters.”
	•	“Jarvis, I have 25 minutes. Give me the highest leverage task.”

Visual app
	•	Inbox: unified triage for email, messages, tasks, notes.
	•	Today: plan, time blocks, top outcomes, active timers.
	•	Projects: goals, next actions, assets, stakeholders.
	•	Memory: people, companies, preferences, decisions, definitions.
	•	Activity log: everything Jarvis touched, with undo and approvals.

B) Unified Inbox (the killer feature)

Everything becomes an “item” with status:
	•	Incoming: email, DM, missed call, document comment, Stripe dispute, calendar invite
	•	Created: your voice note, quick thought, idea
	•	Generated: drafts, summaries, suggested tasks

Each item has:
	•	action buttons (Reply, Delegate, Schedule, Add task, Snooze, Archive)
	•	a “Jarvis suggestion” panel (what it thinks you should do and why)
	•	a “one sentence goal” field (so execution stays aligned)

If you do not nail the unified inbox, the product becomes another app users avoid.

C) Agentic workflows, not automations

Users do not want “if this then that” setups. They want outcomes.

Examples:
	•	Daily startup routine
	•	reviews calendar, deadlines, key metrics
	•	surfaces risk list: “these 2 deals are stalling”, “cash runway dropped”, “support backlog spiked”
	•	proposes the day plan
	•	End-of-day shutdown
	•	captures loose ends
	•	updates “waiting on”
	•	prepares tomorrow’s top 3
	•	Client onboarding
	•	creates folder structure, kickoff doc, invoice, intro email, calendar series
	•	generates task list and assigns dates
	•	Weekly review
	•	compiles accomplishments, KPIs, pipeline, wins and losses
	•	proposes next week focus and what to drop

D) Memory that behaves like a professional assistant

Memory is not “I remember you like pizza.” It is operational:
	•	People: roles, preferences, last interaction, open loops
	•	Projects: goals, constraints, decisions, status
	•	Writing style: tone profiles (direct, friendly, legal, salesy)
	•	Rules: “Never schedule meetings before 10”, “No Fridays”, “Protect deep work 9-12”
	•	Definitions: product terminology, pricing, customer segments

Critical: memory must be editable, inspectable, and segmentable (personal vs work).

E) Collaboration model

Jarvis should feel like a teammate:
	•	It proposes, you approve, it executes.
	•	It can ask targeted questions when ambiguity is expensive.
	•	It can run in “silent mode” where it queues actions and you approve in batches.
	•	It supports “confidence levels” and “risk tiers” per action.

F) Focus protection

A productivity assistant that does not protect attention is a joke.
	•	“Do Not Disturb with intent”: only interrupts for high-priority people or events.
	•	Batches notifications into scheduled review windows.
	•	Detects context switching and suggests batching: “You are bouncing between sales and product. Pick one for 45 minutes.”

The UX needs to be ruthless

If you want “extremely powerful” and “extremely intuitive”, you need constraints.

Voice UX rules
	•	Commands must be short and forgiving.
	•	Jarvis should confirm only when risk is high.
	•	It should respond with a summary first, details on request.
	•	It should offer a single best next action, not a menu.

Visual UX rules
	•	3 primary tabs max on iPhone.
	•	One dominant action per screen.
	•	Search is universal and fast.
	•	Everything can be corrected manually in 2 taps.
	•	The Activity Log is always accessible.

⸻

Operating modes
	1.	Assist mode: drafts and suggests, you send.
	2.	Operator mode: executes within guardrails (scheduling, filing, drafting, task creation).
	3.	Autopilot mode: low-risk recurring workflows run automatically, you get a digest.

Users should start in Assist, graduate to Operator, then selectively enable Autopilot.

⸻

What it integrates with (realistic scope)

Start with what a solo entrepreneur actually uses daily:
	•	Apple Calendar, Reminders, Mail, Contacts
	•	Gmail, Google Calendar (optional)
	•	Slack, WhatsApp (if feasible), iMessage (limited by platform)
	•	Notion, Google Docs, Dropbox
	•	Stripe, PayPal, banking exports (read-first)
	•	Linear/Jira/Trello, HubSpot/Pipedrive
	•	Zoom/Meet
	•	A browser extension for “capture and summarize” on Mac

Hard truth: some Apple surfaces are restricted. You will not get full Siri-level integration without compromises. Plan for:
	•	app-level voice experience
	•	widgets, shortcuts, share sheet
	•	push notifications with approve/deny actions

⸻

Safety, privacy, and trust (you cannot handwave this)

If you touch email, calendar, money, and personal life, trust is product.

Must-haves:
	•	granular permissions per integration and per action type
	•	local-first where possible for indexing, with encrypted sync
	•	action confirmations for high-risk actions (send, delete, publish, pay)
	•	“why did you do that” explanations tied to the log
	•	easy kill switch: pause all automations instantly

⸻

Metrics that matter

If these do not improve, your product is not Jarvis, it is another chatbot.
	•	Time saved per week (measured via actions executed and triage reduction)
	•	Open loops reduced (waiting on, overdue, unanswered)
	•	Context switches per hour (proxy via app switching and notification handling)
	•	Response latency to key stakeholders
	•	Weekly review completion rate
	•	Retention by “Operator mode enabled” users

⸻

MVP that actually has a chance

Do not start with “do everything.” Start with a wedge that becomes the hub.

MVP Phase 1: Unified Inbox + Drafting
	•	Connect Gmail/Calendar + Apple Calendar if possible
	•	Triage, summarize, draft replies
	•	Turn messages into tasks and schedule followups
	•	Daily plan creation from tasks + calendar
	•	Activity log + approval flows

Phase 2: Scheduling + Meeting briefs
	•	auto scheduling with constraints
	•	pre-brief and post-meeting capture
	•	followup automation

Phase 3: Workflows + Memory
	•	onboarding workflow templates
	•	weekly review
	•	structured memory for people and projects

Phase 4: Operator mode expansions
	•	CRM updates
	•	invoicing and payment reminders
	•	content publishing workflows

⸻

Example interactions (what it should feel like)

Morning
	•	You: “Jarvis, what matters today?”
	•	Jarvis: “Three outcomes: close Acme renewal, ship v1.3, unblock hiring. You have two meetings. I suggest deep work 9-11 on v1.3 and send Acme proposal at 11:15. Want me to draft the Acme email now?”

Email
	•	You: “Reply yes, but push to next week, keep it friendly.”
	•	Jarvis: Draft appears, you approve by voice: “Send.”

Meeting
	•	Jarvis 10 minutes before: “Goal: agree on scope and timeline. Last time they objected to pricing. Suggested agenda and your 2 strongest arguments are ready.”

End of day
	•	Jarvis: “You have 5 open loops that will age poorly. Want me to nudge two of them now and schedule the rest for tomorrow morning?”

⸻

The biggest traps to avoid
	•	Trying to be a general chatbot. That space is crowded and commoditized.
	•	No unified inbox. Without it, you cannot own the workflow.
	•	Too many confirmations. You will kill the speed advantage.
	•	Too much autonomy early. One bad send or wrong calendar change and trust dies.
	•	Messy memory. If memory is wrong and hard to edit, users churn.
